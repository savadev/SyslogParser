# SyslogParser
Python script to parse certain keywords (errors, critical messages etc) from linux syslogs and notify admin if there are any. 

Edit configuration file (file.json) and enter SMTP credentials and settings. Then enter the syslog files you want to monitor and pair those with desired keywords (see example configuration). You can use asterisk in file path to include multiple files.
